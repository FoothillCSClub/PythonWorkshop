# Foothill CS Club Python Workshop!

This is an introductory workshop to show you how to get started with the Python programming language.

## That's cool, but how do I start?

Well, first you'll want to download Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org):
* For OSX: [App file](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-macosx10.6.pkg)
* For 64-bit Windows: [installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe)
* For 32-bit Windows: [installer](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0.exe)
* For linux, you'll want to install a program called IDLE using your package manager.

Once you're done installing Python, open up [cheetsheet.py](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FoothillCSClub/PythonWorkshop/master/cheatsheet.py) and save it somewhere you can find it later.

Then, open up Python. It should be appear in your system's applications folder or start menu.

In the window that opens, go to *File* > *Open...* and find the cheetsheet.py file you downloaded earlier.

Once that's open, you should be good to go!
